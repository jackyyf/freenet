Freenet
=======

Freenet Project is a project that to provide a free 6to4 vpn.  
In China, many college has free ipv6 internet access, but **EXPENSIVE AND SLOW** ipv4 network.  
This repo mainly stores some script used in freenet project. All script are released under MIT License.  

This project needs your help! Currently we are using cheap VPS, with not so good network, and limited bandwith.
If everyone who loves this project can make a donation, I can focus on provide a better network instead of worry about money to pay for those VPS.
